          Seraina Fässler, aka Seina, is a composer and sound designer working
          at the intersection of algorithmic sound, digital instruments, and
          field recording. Her ambient soundscapes are ethereal, precise, and
          unpredictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her practice centers on creative coding in SuperCollider, where she
          builds custom tools for live performance and sound design. In 2025,
          she completed a Bachelor's degree in Sonology at the Royal
          Conservatoire in The Hague, with a focus on custom digital
          instruments. Her debut EP Juni was released in August 2024 on the
          Lucerne-based label Präsens Editionen.
        </p>

          Alongside her solo work, Seraina collaborates with artists, designers,
          and institutions on soundscapes for multimedia installations,
          websites, and artworks. Recent collaborators include Terrafranta,
          Céline Hurka & Jules Janssen × Radio Watches × Vienna Design Week,
          Opera Forward Festival Amsterdam, Javkhlan Ariunbold, and the Together
          Together Collective from Den Haag.
        </p>

          She was recently selected to compose a new work for
          the Acousmonium of GRM Paris, premiering in 2026. She is also one half
          of the duo Swimming Pool, currently performing across Europe.
          Furthermore, she is part of Unsync, a collective initiative supporting
          women in electronic music.
